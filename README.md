# Usage


## List Pools

    vmpool list

See what pools are currently available in the infrastructure.

## Grab a VM

    vmpool grab <pool name>


After you grab the VM, you'll need to use the testing (beaker) private key to access the systems.


## Delete a VM

    vmpool delete <vm name>


Deleting a VM is good for the overall resource utilization if you're done with the VM. They will be destroyed in 12 hours if you don't remove them before that.

## Grabbing multiple VMs

To fetch multiple vms simply provide whatever valid platforms
you desire as arguements to the grab command.

For example:
```
~> vmpool grab debian-7-x86_64 debian-7-x86_64 centos-7-i386
centos-7-i386: qv7uij5ofqj7pqs.delivery.puppetlabs.net
debian-7-x86_64:
    qer906rgo66zhwp.delivery.puppetlabs.net
    f2uie2kr56hjg34.delivery.puppetlabs.net
```


## Configuring what vmpooler host you hit

You can export `VMPOOL_URL` to point to any vmpooler.

By default it points to  https://vmpooler.delivery.puppetlabs.net/vm.
